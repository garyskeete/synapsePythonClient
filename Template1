Disease Research Template

Parkinson's Disease Research2
1.
The application of medical equipment utilizing lasers magnetic systems frequencies sonar sonics photonics encephalograms in combination and in concert with ultrasound equipment,head to toes examination and non invasive treatment
2.
Reduced to 
The application of an iPhone or monitor transmitting impulses non invasively to impact and succeed in treatments by involving the patient in a transfer of information that is practical and portable.
3.
Reduced further
Into the application of a computerized tattoo or patch. The smaller yet effective connection serves as miniaturized proof of the efficiency of long term treatments due to quantum integration in circuits. Waterproof.
4.
Final Reduction
The application of either nanotechnology or nano medicine. The micro machines would float in the stomach and gut and emit impulses and command molecules to interact producing a healing effect. The medicine multifaceted would formulate into multiplication on a daily basis of stem cells along with that production dissipation of diseased cells and bonding with microscopic criteria that produces stability and reduction of disease state in a lifelong pursuit.
